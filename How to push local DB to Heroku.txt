To upload my local PostgreSQL DB to HEROKU:
 
Open command line

>heroku pg:reset -- app radiant-dusk-53993

confirm by typing in the name of app

>heroku pg:push UPaintDB DATABASE_URL --app radiant-dusk-53993

I had to first create an user in pgadmin that matched my windows account - "Dan"
Then enter the password for that user in pgadmin

the local db will push up!
